Best City Competition
---------------------


This is my entry for the `Best City Competition`_ that was run by the 
`Economist Intelligence Unit`_ (EIU) and Buzzdata_.

The EIU collect lots of data on cities all over the world, to see how liveable
they are based on lots of different factors - from how safe the city is to the
quality of the nightclubs in the city. The goal of this competition was to use
this data to create a new type of liveability index. You can read my method for
tackling this problem in `best.city.pdf`.

This is one of my first experiences writing interactive data visualisations
like this and I enjoyed it, learning a lot in the process.

I've uploaded the visualisation and also the R script which creates my
liveability index.
